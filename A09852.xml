            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Richard Porder Perſon of Saint Peters on Cornchill in London aforeſayd: vviſheth helth and proſperitie, vvith the feare of God, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſaluation in Chriſt.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>EING THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovvlye perſvvaded (Right Honorable, woorſhipfull, and dearely beloued in our Sauiour Chriſt) that other Citizens and folk of tovvnes and Countries tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovve this vvhole Realme, doe take (as it vvere) light and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions at you of this honourable Citie: I haue thought it moſt meete to direct this my ſimple vvorke to you, and you to be defenders thereof againſt the aduerſarie, to the ende that thoſe, vvho take enſample of you, maye ſee,
<pb facs="tcp:12245:5"/>
that you doe not allow of thoſe things: which are condemned by this worke, whereof you are willing Patrones.</p>
            <p>And I call you willing Patrones of this my worke, bicauſe that (after I had prepared the ſame for the Croſſe, and preached it to you in the Church, by occaſion of raine) I was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunatelye prouoked by many worſhipfull Citizens to write and put in print the ſame Sermon, ſpecially that which I had ſayde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning vſurie. Which earneſt requeſts of theirs hath drawne mee (as it were) to doe that: for which the aduerſaries, perhaps will accuſe mee both of ſuperfluous folly and raſh trauayle, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe after ſo many great Clarkes of olde time, and alſo of late dayes, hath handled this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Vſurie at large: I take in hande to write of the ſame, and make certaine trades ſubiect, to the definition of forbidden Vſurie: which none of thoſe godlye and great learned men, hath once mentioned in their writings.</p>
            <p>But to excuſe my ſelfe from vndiſcrete fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, in calling that Vſurie, which ſo manye godly &amp; learned writers make no mention of in their doings: I ſay either men in their times, and in their countries, haue not ſo openlye ſhewed themſelues to the worlde, to bee V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers, nor defended that vile trade to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt trafficke, as men paſt all ſhame doe at
<pb facs="tcp:12245:5"/>
this time: and in this our lande. So that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as I thinke) further occaſioned, haue ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially named that: which theſe men haue but in generalitie condemend.</p>
            <p>And as many of great worſhip haue required me thus to doe: ſo were they content, yea, and (that which is more) my Lord Maior willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be patrons herof. And my hope is to haue more defending members than aduerſaries in this bodye pollitike, ſeeing I haue ſpoken the truth.</p>
            <p>I knowe that many haue exclaymed and doe exclayme againſt this Citie for Vſurie, and I would there were no cauſe. But when thoſe exclaymers are themſelues alſo Vſurers, and will not ſee it, but colour it by ſelling of time, they may bluſhe with ſhame ynough, and ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther firſt amende themſelues, or elſe ceaſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation. For it is ſhame for one to rebuke an other of that fault, wherein the rebuker him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is guiltie.</p>
            <p>But I ſpeake not this to quallifie anye vice committed by Citizens, be it Vſurie, or other: For my earneſt deſire is to haue a redreſſe of faultes in Citie and Countrie.</p>
            <p>And therfore, as you of this Citie, are giuers of light or darkeneſſe to others through this Realme, ſo I beſeeche you for Gods loue, firſt to beginne a redreſſe, and euen with all ſpeede
<pb facs="tcp:12245:6"/>
ſhine foorth light of good conuerſation, and honeſt lawfull trade, whereby others maye followe your good example, and that God may be glorified. Let euery man put to his helping hand, the Magiſtrate with power, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior with prayer to God. There wanteth but only good will. We haue but a ſhort race here to runne, and how ſhort god onely knoweth, happy is he that runneth a good courſe to the ende. Let vs be moued while God doth yet call and beſeech vs, leaſt he kepe ſilence &amp; ſcurge vs.</p>
            <p>And though the wicked, who regarde not God, will giere, cauill, ſcoffe, ſlaunder, kick, and will not be moued with any thing to leaue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill: yet I know the godly and wiſe (for whoſe ſake I haue chiefly done it) wil be content with this my trauayle, and will gladly and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullye embrace the truth, and endeuor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe faultes without delay. To whome God for Chriſtes ſake giue ſtrength: and perſite his woorke in them, and deliuer our Queene, this our Citie and Realme, from plagues now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, and bleſſe and defende the godlye inhabitants to the glory of his holy Maieſtie, and deſtruction of Satans kingdome.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LBEIT, good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vices, I haue in this Sermon (as alſo hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other by mée preached at Paules Croſſe) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyghed chiefly againſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurie: it was not for that I did or doe account <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury in it ſelfe to be the moſt horribleſt vice beyonde all other, but bicauſe the ſame vice in this our time, is ſo vniuerſally committed, that not only money men, Merchant men, and Citizens, be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: but alſo Noblemen, Courtiers, Gentlemen, Graſiers, Farmers, Plowmen and Artificers, yea, I would
<pb facs="tcp:12245:7"/>
the Clergie were frée.</p>
            <p>So that the vice <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurie, amongſt the multitude, is accounted no vice, and thought ſo neceſſarie: that without it men (generally) cannot liue. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thought good (ſo ſpeciallye) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the ſame vice, and to ſhewe men (if they willl ſée) this their fault.</p>
            <p>For though <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurie be but a part (yet a great part) of extortion and oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and extortion and oppreſſion, be but fruites of Couetouſneſſe, and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all theſe doe ſpring out of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie and diſtruſting God, (which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt is the roote of euery wicked act:) yet when ſuch euill fruite ſhall be ſo v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſally eaten, as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurie now is, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with gréedineſſe and delight: it is more than time to ſhewe the perill thereof, yea, and that with all diligence. And except we ſhoulde be content wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglye to ſée (as it were) the blinde drowne himſelfe in the ditche, and the
<pb facs="tcp:12245:7"/>
childe to play with the Serpent, or eate ſwéete Kattes bane to his owne poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and deſtruction: we cannot omit to ſhewe the generall abuſe in trades, by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurie, and ſo ſpecially to reprooue it, and tell men the daunger of it, namely, that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurie being a fruite of infidelitie: cannot but poyſon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuer.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, that God forbiddeth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie, I haue ſhewed by the Lawe, by the Prophets, and by the Goſpell. Alſo I haue ſhewed howe godlye men and good Magiſtrates both Chriſten and Heathen, haue deteſted the ſame vice, &amp; him that committed it: &amp; what puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſome people executed vpon ſuch offenders. And partly, I haue ſhewed (for I thinke no man can fully declare it) what hurt there groweth by vſurie to the Church of God, &amp; to the common weale. I haue alſo ſhewed the abuſe of trades by that they are generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
<pb facs="tcp:12245:8"/>
with vſurie in this our time: and anſwered to ſome obiections of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. And then hauing giuen a taſte of honeſt and lawfull occupying: I finiſh that matter.</p>
            <p>But before I beginne to ſpeake of vſurie, I haue according to my ſimple knowledge made plaine the text, and gathered thereon ſuch notes, as I thought apt and profitabe for this our time, plainely according to the plaine ſpeaking of my Patrone and example <hi>Sophonie</hi> without qualifications. For it is not tyme to dallye or ſooth men nowe in their doings: no more than it was in <hi>Sophonies</hi> time. And in the latter ende of my theame, where it is ſayde, that God will roote out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroye ſuch, as neyther ſéeke after God nor regarde him: there I take occaſion to examine by the doings of men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they at this day doe ſéeke for God and regarde him, or not, for by the
<pb facs="tcp:12245:8"/>
fruite the trée is knowne.</p>
            <p>And ſo amongeſt the manyfolde fruites of infidelitie inerplicable: I ſpeake perticularly of fewe, but ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allye of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurie, for the reaſon before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged. Wherin though ſuch methode be not obſerued, as ſome maye thinke perhaps Art requireth: yet I haue kept that courſe therein, which I haue thought moſt profitable.</p>
            <p>And though in reſpect of mine owne weakeneſſe, and the ſubtiltie of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, I am not eaſilye drawne to ſet out my ſimple doings to the worlde in print: yet by the earneſt procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſundry worſhipfull men, with the ſpeciall requeſtes of manye my friendes: I haue bene mooued to print the ſame. And the rather I haue bene moued ſo to doe, bicauſe I would here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by eyther ſtoppe the mouthes of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, and of ſuch as haue priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made childiſh obiections to this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
<pb facs="tcp:12245:9"/>
not worthy to be aunſwered: or elſe ſtirre them to make ſtronger rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt it, if they can. And alſo (if they know another truth herein) to ſet out their mindes in writing to the world, and not mutter in corners.

            <p>WE reade in the fourth Booke of Kings, &amp; alſo in the ſeconde of the Chronicles, that after the death of good <note place="margin">4. Reg. ca. 21. 2. Paral. ca. 33.</note> 
               <hi>Ezechias:</hi> wicked <hi>Manaſſes</hi> ſuccéeded king of Iuda &amp; Ieruſalem, who did euil in the ſight of the Lorde, as did the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then whom the Lord caſt out before the
<pb facs="tcp:12245:11"/>

He offered his ſonne in fire, brought an Idol into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords temple, and gaue héede to witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft and ſorcerie, and mainteyned workers with ſpirites, and fortune tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. Whereby he made Iuda and the indwellers of Ieruſalem to erre, and to doe worſe than the Heathen whome the Lorde deſtroyed before them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the Lorde brought him into the handes of the Aſſirian Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines his enimies, who bounde him in chaines, and led him priſoner to Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, where he repented and humbled himſelfe before the Lord God. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtored to his kingdome, he ſought a reformation according to the will of <note place="margin">Afflictions profitable to Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> God, whome he learned more exactlye to knowe, by chaines and priſon: than ever he did before by his crowne and

ſcepter. And after <hi>Manaſſes</hi> death, his ſonne <hi>Amon</hi> was made king in his place, who walked in all the abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of his father, &amp; did that which was euill in the ſight of the Lorde. He neither regarded the commaundement of God, nor the example of his fathers repentance. Wherefore God puniſhed his ſinne by ſinne, what time his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes conſpired and ſlewe him in his owne houſe.</p>
            <p>After whoſe death (about. 3312. yeares from the making of the worlde, <note place="margin">In that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked fathers haue good children, and good fathers wicked chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, it is ſene that goodnes is not of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but of grace.</note> and. 658. yeares before the incarnation of Chriſt, the ſonne of <hi>Amon,</hi> godlye <hi>Ioſias,</hi> at the age of eyght yeares, was made king ouer Iuda and Ieruſalem. He did that which was right in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſight of the Lorde, and walked in the wayes of his father <hi>Dauid,</hi> &amp; neyther bowed to the right hande nor to the left. Hée ſpéedilye began to ſéeke the Lorde, and in the twelfth yeare of his reygne, he beganne to purge Iuda and Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
<pb facs="tcp:12245:12"/>
from Idolatrie, and ſo reformed <note place="margin">Godly Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doe helpe their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme abuſes in religion. 2. <hi>Paral.</hi> 34.</note> religion, not only in Iuda and Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, but alſo amongſt his neyghbours that were left in Iſraell, when the moſt part of them were led away captiue by the Aſſirians, he deſtroyed the hill aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, Idoll groues, and Images, and burnt the bones of the Idolatrous ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificers vppon their owne altars, as was prophecied of him aboue. 350. yeres <note place="margin">3. Reg. 13. 2 Ieremie. 1.</note> before.</p>
            <p>In the .xiij. yeare of his reigne the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> began to prophecie, and the King in the .xviij. yeare of hys reigne, going about to repaire the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the booke of Gods lawe was found, which long time before (through the <note place="margin">4. <hi>Re.</hi> 22. 23. 2. <hi>Paral.</hi> 34. Tirannie and negligence, darkners of truth.</note> tyrannie and Idolatrie of Princes, and negligence of the Prieſtes) lay hid and vnknowne. Now when this good King vnderſtoode of this booke, and had heard it reade: he rent his clothes through re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his fathers offences and his owne, and ſent to aſke councell of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12245:12"/>
the Lord what was to be done concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that booke. He read this Booke <note place="margin">The godlye ceaſe not ice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: till they knowe Gods wil, and when they know it: they doe not neglect to doe it.</note> himſelfe vnto all the people when hée had gathered them togither, and made a couenant with the Lord touching the ſame to gouerne according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe rules thereof.</p>
            <p>In the .xx. yere of this Kings reigne, <hi>Sophony</hi> the Prophet began to ſpeake in the name of the Lord. The beginning <note place="margin">

            <p>In handling wherof, I meane to vſe none other methode: than that which the Prophet hath prouided for me, who firſt threatneth a rooting out of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and mixers of religion, with the remnauntes of Idolatry.

            <p>IN that God doth threaten here to deſtroy, not onlye men, but alſo vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures: wee maye learne howe deteſtable a thing ſinne is, in the ſight of God, and ſpecially Idolatrie, for as wee reade, though <hi>Ioſias</hi> had now reformed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:12245:13"/>
many abuſes, put downe Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and brought in place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the true ſeruice of God: it is ſayde, that God was yet angrye for that peoples Idolatrie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly committed, and ſtill ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintayned, notwithſtanding the publike reformation. But here two thinges maye ſeeme ſtraunge at the firſt vewe, thone, why now in the dayes of ſo good a King, who had reformed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, baniſhed Idolatrie, and <note place="margin">Two things ſeeme ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge here.</note> executed the Idolaters to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt of his power: God doth thus threaten more grieuouſly: than he did in the dayes of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes</hi> or <hi>Amon,</hi> thoſe wicked Kings that had ſet vp ydolatrie.</p>
            <p>The other, why <hi>Sophonie</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth not his Prophecie or preaching with doctrine as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb facs="tcp:12245:14"/>
other Prophetes and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers doe: but thundreth euen at the firſt theſe horrible threates.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, by good conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that ſtate and time, we ſhall without difficultie perceyue in the one &amp; the other, the iuſt and <note place="margin">God doth moſt iuſtly and wiſely proceede in his iudgementes.</note> holye iudgements of God, moſt wiſely &amp; orderly put in execution.</p>
            <p>For though God had now ſent theſe people ſo good a Prince as had baniſhed Idolatrie, execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Idolaters, and erected the true worſhip and ſeruice of God publikely ſo much as was in his power both in his owne dominions of Iuda and Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, &amp; alſo amongſt his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours the Iſraelites: yet thoſe <note place="margin">Cauſes why God doth threatten ſo ſharply in this good kings reigne.</note> people for the moſt part playde the hypocrites, and ſecrete Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrers, and kept remnantes or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:12245:14"/>
reliques of <hi>Baal, Moloch,</hi> or <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chom,</hi> and other Idols, they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretely worſhipped the hoſte of heauen, and gaue heede to Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and ſpirites of error as may appeare.</p>
            <p>Yea though the Prophet <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> (by the ſpace of ſeauen yeres before <hi>Sophonie</hi> beganne) had <note place="margin">Cauſes why Sophony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie with threates.</note> preached to them, ſhewed them their faultes, and preached doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine for their learning (if they woulde haue learned:) yet they neyther regarded that great good gift of god, namely ſo good a King, that trulye worſhipped God, and defended true religion and iuſtice: nor yet his holy word and calling, ſent them vnder the ſame king by the Prophete <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</hi> And therefore it was, that now God raiſed vp this prophet
<pb facs="tcp:12245:15"/>
               <hi>Sophonie,</hi> as it were ſodeinly to thunder oute theſe threates, for this their great ingratitude and peſtilent perſeuerance in their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie, ſuperſtition, and other wickedneſſes, continued in this tyme of ſo gentle calling, good gouernement, and cleere light.</p>
            <p>For the greater &amp; better giftes and benifites that men doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne <note place="margin">Hebrues. 2.</note> or neglect, the greater plagues or puniſhments are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued and procured by ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude. And certainelye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all thexternall giftes of God in this lyfe, there is none comparable to this, that GOD vouchſafeth to let men haue his holy and eternall word preached <note place="margin">Aucthoritie ioyned wyth truth, a moſt excellent bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in this lyfe.</note> amongeſt them, and ſpeciallye when hee ioyneth therewith the power of good magiſtrates. And
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12245:15"/>
therefore when ſuch treaſure is by men neglected or contemned: it is no maruell that GOD doth threaten extreme puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as here he doth by this <hi>Sophonie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though I contende not with thoſe that do thinke <hi>Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> did this by aduyſe and conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with <hi>Ieremie:</hi> yet I am <note place="margin">It was not by pollicie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Jeremy and Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonie began with threates, but Gods iuſt working vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon moſt apt occaſion.</note> not of their minde, but doe feele otherwiſe of it, euen that GOD who miniſtreth perfite medicine according to mens diſeaſes: did ſtirre vp this Prophet <hi>Sophonie</hi> to go amongſt that people, euen vpon iuſt and moſt apt occaſion, as it were ſodeinlye, thereby, the more to quicken them that were in their dead ſleepe of Idolatrie and iniquitie.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:12245:16"/>

But contrarywiſe did well lyke of his doing, knowing who had ſent him. For they could in no wiſe diſſent or iarre, being both meſſengers from God, and gouerned by one ſpirite.</p>
            <p>And hereof, thoſe that now do preach the Goſpell haue a good <note place="margin">A note for Preachers.</note> rule, namely, that one blame not the other, though one vſe ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and an other vſe mildeneſſe in teaching, or that one teache that: which another hath not taught before him, except the doctrine be falſe and agaynſt the truth, or that they preach <hi>placen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> to the ſtubborne wicked, and

            <p>Now we maye as I ſayde, ſee by this text and conſideration of that ſtate and time, howe God doth proceede with them in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and iudgement, and he is ſtill one and the ſame God.</p>
            <p>He firſt ſendeth them his word and true ſeruice, by the miniſtery of a good magiſtrate, and a holy Prophet, he ſheweth them their <note place="margin">God firſt calleth men by fayre meanes.</note> faultes and offreth them pardon, and praieth them to forſake their lewde wayes, and to turne to him, and he wil yet receiue them.</p>
            <p>When by theſe gentle callings &amp; great benifits beſtowed vpon them, they will not bee wonne, but continue in their vices, and
<pb facs="tcp:12245:17"/>
vtterly thankleſſe for thoſe great benifytes: then God doth not yet ſodeinly deſtroy them. But firſt threatneth that vnleſſe they doe <note place="margin">Secondly, God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, if me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do not regarde gentle calling. <hi>Ionas.</hi> 3.</note> repent: hee will ſcurge, as wee read alſo that God ſayd by <hi>Ionas</hi> yet forty dayes and <hi>Niniue</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed, and before the floud <note place="margin">Geneſis. 6.</note> alſo: yet the dayes of man ſhall be a hundreth and twenty yeres, and I will bring a floud vppon the earth. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If yet neyther by gentle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, nor by threates, they will bee reclaymed, then hee ceaſeth ſpeakynge to them, and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth awaye his worde and good magiſtrates, and for their ſinnes he ſetteth an hypocrite to rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <note place="margin">When men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle calling nor threates: then God puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, and ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth ſilence.</note> them, ſendeth enimies in vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, ſpoyleth them of their ioye, bringeth them into captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

and ſo many wayes ſcurgeth them, that he maketh them know by ſtripes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they woulde neuer know by faire meanes: ſo it came to paſſe with theſe people of Iuda and Ieruſalem. For neyther by gentle callinges, nor benifites, nor threates, they woulde ceaſe from their owne wayes, as appeareth that within three or fower monethes after the death of this good king <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And whereas this good king <hi>Ioſias,</hi> and the Prophete <hi>Ieremie,</hi> did know that religion ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, <note place="margin">4. Regum. 22 2.

            <p>The Plannettes and Starres are called the hoſt of heauen ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the continuall and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye courſe which they haue kept from the beginning, and in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of their multitude or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. <note place="margin">Sun, Mone, and Starres, called the hoſt of heauen: for the multitude or for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall courſe, or for power of gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thought to be in them.</note> Or elſe for that men did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to them the power of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernance in earthly thinges, as mighty Gods.

            <p>The Aſtrologians of our time are not fullye ſo blockiſhe as to builde aultars, and to worſhippe the ſame hoſte of heauen as they

            <p>Now if they can doe in deede theſe things which they take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them (as I am perſwaded they cannot) their cunning is for the rareneſſe ſtraunge.</p>

            <p>But admitte their knowledge were certaine, that they could tell how long a man ſhould liue, and howe fortunate or vnfortunate he were: yet what of this? what are they or any man elſe the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for it?

            <p>Then foraſmuch as this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge helpeth not, but rather <note place="margin">

in two Sermons at the Croſſe, ſayde my minde partlye therein, according to my ſimple <note place="margin">Somewhat ſayde in two former Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of vſury</note> knowledge. And alſo that the learned fathers both of olde time and in theſe our dayes, haue both ſpoken and written thereof, in much better wiſe, than I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <note place="margin">Learned haue written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vſury.</note> and yet the multitude doe continue herein, rather increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this vice, than ceaſing from it, yea, and do account it no vice: What profite may I looke for to <note place="margin">What ſhall I profite?</note> come, of this my trauaile? what ſucceſſe? or what redreſſe maye I looke for?</p>
            <p>If I ſhoulde herein take vpon <note place="margin">I ſhall bee ſaid to ſpeake arogantly.</note> me to ſay more, than the learned haue done: I might bee counted arrogant and voide of diſcretion.</p>

            <p>And if I ſhal now ſay no more, than heretofore I my ſelfe haue <note place="margin">I ſhall be ſaid to bee ſtill in one ſong.</note> ſayde: I ſhall be counted lyke to the Cuckooe, or Stockdoue, for being alwayes in one ſong.</p>

            <p>If I had not an eie to an other matter from all theſe thinges: I <note place="margin">Siſyphus trauayle.</note> might looke to profit as much by mine induſtrie: as <hi>Siſyphus, qui</hi>

            <p>The obiection is this, that the deliuerer in giuing of a moneth, or two moneths time to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker

other meane, bee it with Gods lawe or agaynſt it: followe and feede theyr deſyre, they will not of neceſſitie (let them ſo conclude as long as they lyſt:) but to fulfill their couetous affections and <note place="margin">

And amongſt all things, that maye ſerue theyr turne: there is not one ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and generall for them, at thys tyme (trades being as they are,) as is this vice of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurie. Wherin not onely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rich, but alſo the meane man, yea and the pore <note place="margin">Riche men and poore: faulty in vſury.</note> (ſo farre as he can) is a doer, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by lending or borrowing at <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurie.</p>
            <p>And ſurelye though the poore man may allege neede for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in borrowing at <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury: yet I cannot account him cleare of fault therein. For, beſides thys,

that he may be perhaps through <note place="margin">The poore man doth not well in taking at vſury.</note> his owne negligence or prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie fallen into that neede: when he is in that neede to go borrowe vpon <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurie: is to make himſelf more needie, and to maintayne a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurer in his wicked trade. And if the needie bee not excuſable in <note place="margin">The riche manne doth worſe in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at vſury.</note> taking at <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury: much leſſe are theſe excuſable that hauing no neede, will take at vſurie. For, thoſe doe it (as before is ſhewed) for a further miſchiefe.</p>
            <p>And for the better vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">Three ſortes of takers, and three ſortes of deliuerers at vſury.</note> hereof: admitte three ſortes of takers, and three ſortes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerers at <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurie.</p>
            <p>Of deliuerers, one ſort are ſuch as lend their mony or wares after the rate of. x. or. xij. pounde by the yere, and ſo content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:12245:101"/>
Another ſort do thinke after. xv. xx. or. xxx. pound in the hundred to little, which they will cutte out by ſale of wares and exchaunge.</p>
            <p>The third ſort are ſuch as will lende money or wares, or both, and cut that waye as deepely as they can, &amp; get landes and leaſes for aſſurance, or Plate in pawne, double or treble the value of that they lende: and in the end ſcrape all into their owne hands, or elſe <note place="margin">The worſt vſurer.</note> they will fayle of their purpoſe, though in deliueraunce of theyr wares and money: they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded great friendſhip toward the <note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurers friendſhip like the Serpent Ceraſtes vait. <hi>Iſidor. lib.</hi> 12.</note> taker. And theſe I doe account the worſt ſort of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurers or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torcioners. And their friendſhip is much like the bayte of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent called <hi>Ceraſtes,</hi> which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent hath ſo lothly a bodye: that
<pb facs="tcp:12245:102"/>
euery eie (but ſpecially the Birds eie) doth abhorre to beholde him. And yet aboue all meate: his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is to eate birdes fleſh. But he <note place="margin">The Serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Ceraſtes hornes: lyke two wormes, baytes for birdes to their deſtruction.</note> cannot flie, for he is a creeper and hath not wings, and therefore to obtaine his pray or deſire, he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth himſelfe in ſand, al ſauing his two lyther hornes that grow in his forehead: which he layeth aboue vpon the ſande, like two wormes that were comming out of the earth: when the birds eſpy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame like Wormes, &amp; ſuppoſe to haue foode thereon, they light downe to take them, and ſo are thereby made foode to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, which they woulde neuer <note place="margin">If y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pore ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker did know the venomous baytes of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers: they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of their byting.</note> haue beene: if they coulde haue ſeene the lothly beaſt. No more think I would ſuch men as take of theſe worſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurers: if they
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:12245:102"/>
ſawe theyr foule and rauening mindes towardes them.</p>
            <p>And of takers at vſury, one ſort taketh, hauing no neede, but to engroſſe markets, &amp; ſo to make a Monopolion of thinges, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently a dearth in the midſt of plentie, and free markets to <note place="margin">This taker worſe in a common weale than he that runneth away withall, and therefore a vengeaunce honeſt man.</note> be bound to his couetous deſire: to what hurte of the common weale, a man of meane iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may partly ſee.</p>
            <p>Another ſort of takers at vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, are ſuch as take with one hande, and deliuer it with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand out at vſurie to a more cutting rate, eyther money or wares: and theſe are ſuche as lacke ſtocke, and yet will bee oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiers. And though ſome of <note place="margin">He that thry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth moſts after thys ſort: is the worſt in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale.</note> theſe thriue, yet is their ſtocke accurſed: beyng vnhoneſt gayne.
<pb facs="tcp:12245:103"/>
And though they thriue, yet it is to the great hurt of the common weale, and therfore better than they and their trade were both cut off.</p>
            <p>But for the moſte parte, they thriue at the three termes (as they ſay) &amp; become bankruptes. The thirde ſort of takers at vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <note place="margin">The purſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker maketh ſpeede. <hi>Pſalme.</hi> 36.</note> are ſuch as will take all, (and more to if they coulde come by it) with a minde aforehande neuer to repay that they borrow.</p>
            <p>And ſometime this extreeme taker doeth match with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treeme deliuerer. And being as craftye as the deliuerer, doth ſo <note place="margin">Courtly cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſie, and gay greeting.</note> ſurely eſpie his Ceraſticall lither horns that he pulleth them quite out of his head. For the deliuerer <note place="margin">Like vnto like quoth the deuill to hys derling.</note> ſeeing the takers neede: mindeth to rake him euen to the harde

But the taker giueth him fayre wordes minding to requite hys gentleneſſe: by running awaye <note place="margin">One friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip aſketh an other.</note> with all, when he ſeeth his moſt aduauntage.

            <p>Howbeit, I am not ignorant, that if mercy, or compaſſion, did poſſeſſe rich mens heartes, and <note place="margin">If me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would be honeſt: faults were ſoone amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> truth and fidelitie the hartes of the poorer: a redreſſe were ſone had of theſe miſchieuous abuſes.</p>
